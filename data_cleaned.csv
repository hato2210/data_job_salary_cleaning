Today a handful of corporations control 90% of the world's data and IT infrastructure and we are expected to trust them. This is not just bad for business; it's bad for everyone. Information asymmetry has led to social inequality, scandals, polarization, and corruption. Sometimes, it has even led to war. Centralized data control acts as a potential chokepoint for innovation, raises privacy concerns, and creates a bottleneck for the free flow of data.

Australian Antarctic Division
Kingston, TAS
Who we are
The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) is part of the Commonwealth Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. As primary agency for Australia's Antarctic Program (AAP), the AAD is responsible for achieving the Australian Government's Antarctic goals. These goals are to:
Maintain the Antarctic Treaty System and enhance Australia's influence within it.
Protect the Antarctic environment.
The AAD also has responsibility for administering the Australian Antarctic Territory and the Territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands.

The AAD Science Branch leads, conducts and supports a world class program of scientific research and environmental management, consistent with national priorities through the Australian Antarctic Science Strategic Plan. The branch provides research and advice to support Australia’s Antarctic policy objectives, including participation in the Antarctic Treaty system and other international committees, commissions and intergovernmental panels. It manages and administers the Australian Antarctic Science Program and provides scientific and research advice to support regulatory and management decisions.

The branch provides advice for Antarctic capability projects, conducts impact assessments and develops and implements strategies to address environmental legacies while undertaking targeted outreach promoting the value of Australian Antarctic science. The responsibilities of the Science Branch are diverse as we lead the Australian Government’s scientific program in Antarctica. Our research addresses critical issues including climate change, the human footprint in Antarctica, and the conservation of Antarctic and Southern Ocean wildlife. Our diverse research program covers physical and life sciences in the atmosphere, terrestrial and marine domains.

The Environmental Stewardship Program (ESP), within the Science Branch, is a multidisciplinary program that conducts scientific research and implements evidence-based conservation, environmental management, environmental assessments, remediation and mitigation actions in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic. The program collaborates closely across the AAD to deliver an “actionable Cleaner Antarctica Strategy” for Australian stations, as well as scientific, environmental management and policy outcomes. Key to meeting Australia’s Environmental Stewardship goals is the coordinated use and visualisation of available data to inform evidence based environmental management, planning and policy decisions.

As such, a Geospatial Environmental Management System (GEMS) will be developed and maintained for the collation, display and interrogation of spatial, environmental and station data at and adjacent to Australian Antarctic stations and field camps. For use by all work areas across the AAD, GEMS will enhance the AAD’s ability to minimise and mitigate localised impacts on Antarctica’s unique biodiversity, wilderness and heritage values and support positive environmental outcomes in the planning of on-going operations, new capabilities, redevelopment, decommissioning and remediation at stations and the surrounding environment. The development of GEMS is a key objective of the Australian Antarctic Strategy and 20 Year Action Plan (2022 update).


The Environmental Data Analyst will be responsible for leading a range of data, database, GIS and data visualisation needs of the Environmental Stewardship Program and Science Branch, with primary responsibility for the data management and systems, implementation and management of GEMS.

Today a handful of corporations control 90% of the world's data and IT infrastructure and we are expected to trust them. This is not just bad for business; it's bad for everyone. Information asymmetry has led to social inequality, scandals, polarization, and corruption. Sometimes, it has even led to war. Centralized data control acts as a potential chokepoint for innovation, raises privacy concerns, and creates a bottleneck for the free flow of data.
Openmesh is a cutting-edge new open-source cloud infrastructure and a global open data network aimed at storing important global data without a middleman. It is the largest open web3 data lake, covering approximately 80% of the entire crypto and web3 ecosystem today. In 2023 and 2024, we aim to expand our data coverage to include public health and scientific research data.
Openmesh enables anyone to create their own decentralized data cloud, connect globally, share data securely, slash deployment costs, and automate data cloud setup. The Openmesh Network is designed to collect, store, process, stream, and provide data connectivity for anyone, anywhere, anytime, without the need for registration, licensing, or payments. Think of Openmesh as the internet's open data fabric. It grants universal access and prevents interferences created by regulators, governments, corporations, and even its own creators. The possibilities are endless.
Core Products
Our flagship product, Xnode, is an integral part of this vision, offering a revolutionary platform for developers to build decentralized data clouds. Xnode, enables developers to build their own decentralized data clouds with data connectivity, data APIs, and query & analytics engines in mere minutes, instead of weeks or months. They pay only for computing and storage, sidestepping licensing and setup fees. Xnode facilitates a 10-15 fold cost reduction in running and operating data clouds and can save over 95% of deployment time.
Pythia is a powerhouse analytics & query engine that transforms raw data into actionable insights. Pythia allows anyone to design, build, visualize, and deploy powerful data products.
Unified APIs provide a single endpoint for all crypto & web3 data, making it accessible to anyone, anywhere, without any costs. There are no licenses, registrations, or setup fees involved.
Our vision
Our vision is to democratize data and address information asymmetry at a scale. Data & information is the most valuable commodity in the world. Without quality, reliable data, all webpages, apps, and the entire internet will stop working. We believe access to reliable, unedited information is a fundamental right- an aspect of a free and democratic society. The Core Principles of Openmesh, by design, has no single authority that can alter its data, how the information is distributed or controlled, or who can see what and when. The infrastructure and entire technology stack is open-source and governed by an open-source community.
The opportunity
Learn groundbreaking innovations in Data, Cloud, Blockchain, AI, and Web3 Infrastructure from visionaries, and discover what your dream job is really like.

Australian Antarctic Division
Kingston, TAS
Who we are
The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) is part of the Commonwealth Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. As primary agency for Australia's Antarctic Program (AAP), the AAD is responsible for achieving the Australian Government's Antarctic goals. These goals are to:
Maintain the Antarctic Treaty System and enhance Australia's influence within it.
Protect the Antarctic environment.
Understand the role of Antarctica in the global climate system.
Undertake scientific work of practical, economic and national significance.
The AAD also has responsibility for administering the Australian Antarctic Territory and the Territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands.

The AAD Science Branch leads, conducts and supports a world class program of scientific research and environmental management, consistent with national priorities through the Australian Antarctic Science Strategic Plan. The branch provides research and advice to support Australia’s Antarctic policy objectives, including participation in the Antarctic Treaty system and other international committees, commissions and intergovernmental panels. It manages and administers the Australian Antarctic Science Program and provides scientific and research advice to support regulatory and management decisions.

The branch provides advice for Antarctic capability projects, conducts impact assessments and develops and implements strategies to address environmental legacies while undertaking targeted outreach promoting the value of Australian Antarctic science. The responsibilities of the Science Branch are diverse as we lead the Australian Government’s scientific program in Antarctica. Our research addresses critical issues including climate change, the human footprint in Antarctica, and the conservation of Antarctic and Southern Ocean wildlife. Our diverse research program covers physical and life sciences in the atmosphere, terrestrial and marine domains.

The Environmental Stewardship Program (ESP), within the Science Branch, is a multidisciplinary program that conducts scientific research and implements evidence-based conservation, environmental management, environmental assessments, remediation and mitigation actions in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic. The program collaborates closely across the AAD to deliver an “actionable Cleaner Antarctica Strategy” for Australian stations, as well as scientific, environmental management and policy outcomes. Key to meeting Australia’s Environmental Stewardship goals is the coordinated use and visualisation of available data to inform evidence based environmental management, planning and policy decisions.

As such, a Geospatial Environmental Management System (GEMS) will be developed and maintained for the collation, display and interrogation of spatial, environmental and station data at and adjacent to Australian Antarctic stations and field camps. For use by all work areas across the AAD, GEMS will enhance the AAD’s ability to minimise and mitigate localised impacts on Antarctica’s unique biodiversity, wilderness and heritage values and support positive environmental outcomes in the planning of on-going operations, new capabilities, redevelopment, decommissioning and remediation at stations and the surrounding environment. The development of GEMS is a key objective of the Australian Antarctic Strategy and 20 Year Action Plan (2022 update).

The Job
The Environmental Data Analyst will be responsible for leading a range of data, database, GIS and data visualisation needs of the Environmental Stewardship Program and Science Branch, with primary responsibility for the data management and systems, implementation and management of GEMS.

Duties, tasks and responsibilities include:
Planning, design, implementation, and maintaining usability of environmental and geospatial data sets, databases, information systems, data visualisation and graphical user interfaces to support best practice environmental stewardship in Antarctica and across the Australian Antarctic program. This includes:
Liaising with stakeholders to determine application requirements.
Developing applications or modifying the functionality of existing systems.
This includes development (including coding) and testing, release, training and support for the on-going use of GEMS.
Consolidation and QA/QC of relevant historical and current datasets, including liaising with internal and external Australian Antarctic Division stakeholders including Policy and Strategy, Science, Operations and Logistics, Assets and Technology branches and research partners to ensure a broad range of data types and end-user needs are met.
Ensuring that data and associated systems are actively integrated, managed and maintained, including promotion of appropriate data standards, validation and QA/QC.
Working to independently specify and evaluate solutions.
Documenting, administering, and maintaining the resulting application.
Strategic engagement and collaboration with internal and external stakeholders to communicate relevant technical capabilities and emerging opportunities in the areas of scientific application development and data management that support Environmental Stewardship.
Working in conjunction with the Australian Antarctic Data Centre and the Integrated Digital East Antarctic Program to ensure that GEMS, as a key spatial tool for sustainable environmental planning and management, takes advantage of synergies with the Integrated Digital East Antarctica Program, including sharing of resources and relevant data and data products.
Being a positive team member, and at times, leader of seasonal field programs (whether in Antarctica or from Kingston), leading technical training, field sampling, data gathering, and environmental monitoring at the AAD’s sub-Antarctic and Antarctic stations.
Engaging widely, with advanced skills, to develop and maintain excellent relations with a diverse group of collaborative partners and stakeholders throughout the AAD and with external partners to deliver on environmental stewardship priorities.
Supervision of a small team, promoting diversity and inclusion, performance management, enabling continued employee development and training, and promoting and preserving an inclusive and safe workplace.

 The Role
Our team members come from a wide range of highly diverse disciplines (engineering, sustainability, software, installation/deployment and data science), and we are always looking to build our own talent and help them become successful industry professionals.
Currently, we are looking for Graduate Analysts / Engineers to join our Deployment and Uptime Services Teams (a part of our larger Global Services Team). If you have a passion for how systems work, dabbling in data and networking, and have strong analytical skills then we would love to hear from you. Previous experience in IT/Computer Science, network administration,  device/network troubleshooting and Building BMS/HVAC systems is highly advantageous but not essential. This job will also require you to interact with our clients, so you will need clear communication skills. This candidate will be reporting directly to the Head of Global Services.

If you love being a bit technical, working with data and have strong analytical and collaboration skills then we would love to hear from you. As a Graduate Analyst / Engineer, you can expect to learn all about how smart buildings work and soon make a difference by helping our Global Services team leverage Bueno's data analytics platform to improve the performance and sustainability of our customers' buildings and assets. 
Relevant and demonstrable industry experience is desirable but not essential. This job will also require you to interact with others at Bueno and our clients, so you will need clear communication skills. 
More specifically, you will:
Connect and integrate information systems - Assist in systems integration and implementation projects that get the data flowing into the cloud and across our services.
Learn how data analytics works - see how data analytics is implemented and maintained at scale for potentially thousands of devices that generate millions of data points every 5 minutes or less.
Maintain uptime - help manage the network servers and associated hardware, software, and services that keep data flowing into our platform from all over the world
Troubleshoot data issues - learn how we apply data ingestion techniques to run our platform, maintain the data integrity and engage with customers with analytics insights over 2,000 buildings. Where necessary, run meetings, escalate and discuss incidents with internal and external stakeholders.
Automate our workflow - develop the skills to explore, analyse and establish automation of repetitive and manual processes to improve operational efficiency.
Contribute to our global product development - help to improve the quality and user experience of our global analytics software platform through collaboration with our local (not outsourced!) product development teams.
 Office Locations: The roles will operate out of Bueno's Melbourne Office at Melbourne Central Tower (above Melbourne Central Station).
  Benefits of working with us: 
Bueno believes everyone should share in the success of the business: We have a generous employee stock options scheme 
We believe you know how you work best: flexible, remote-friendly working arrangement and a relaxed office environment and culture whenever you choose to come into the office. 
We don’t do traditional: Although we are city locations, you won’t need to dress “corporate”. Bueno is known to be a t-shirt and sneakers workplace. We like our team to be comfortable and express themselves how they like! 
Work with really cool people: We know every company says it’s about our people but we really mean it when we say the best part about working at Bueno (besides saving the planet) is our people! You aren’t obliged to join our activities or events, but you'll want to. We are a fun team (if we do say so ourselves)! 
Passionate about our purpose: We all have different skill sets and come from different walks of life, but the one thing we all have in common is a shared purpose to leave the world better than we found it. We truly care about making an impact on the environment through data. You can see us by joining climate strikes, riding our bikes to work and coming up with creative solutions on how we can be a more sustainable business and help our clients lower their carbon footprint.
