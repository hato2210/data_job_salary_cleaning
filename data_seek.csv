We need your help to build, improve and maintain the infrastructure required to stream and enrich data from a variety of internal and external sources. Together, we will enhance our cloud-based data platform to get the right info, infer useful things and make better decisions. Then test, and keep improving. In areas where the data platform is already fully functional, you’ll lend your sharp logic to improve internal processes, automate systems, and optimise, well, everything. And down the track, we’d love you to get involved with some Bayesian analysis, machine learning and other interesting data-related projects.
If you get excited by the idea of providing the right data to inform great decisions; and you want that data to be accessible, understandable and trustworthy, then this could be the job for you. If you bring your experience, smarts and detail-oriented brain to help us, we’ll offer a world-class team to learn from, the tools you need to do your thing, and the support you need to flourish.

Worked outside of data team, with our developers, flexing your database and query optimisation skills to decide whether to fix a performance issue they’re having at the database level, or insist that the fix should be in the code (and, that’s fun - they’re an excellent bunch)
Provided an ad-hoc analysis (working with our analysts) to someone who requested it, integrating a one-off data source
Talked with our Data Manager about some of our mid-term plans, and how we’ll support them with data
Re-engineered an existing data flow to handle an order-of-magnitude growth in the amount passing through the flow.
 THESE ARE SOME QUALITIES YOU MUST POSSESS
At least five years experience in a data engineering role 
Advanced working knowledge of SQL and experience in ETL and streaming using a workflow management tool such as Apache NiFi (our chosen tool)

Experience with collecting data from a variety of sources including APIs (good APIs, bad APIs, and ugly APIs)
Strong analytical skills and an ability to perform root cause analysis
Training in at least one of Computer Science, Statistics, Informatics, Information Systems or another relevant quantitative field (or demonstrable skill in one of those areas and the story of how you built that skill without formal training)

We're REA
REA Group  is not your average digital business. From humble beginnings in a garage in Melbourne’s east in 1995, we have grown into a leading global digital business, specialising in property.

With bold and ambitious goals, we are changing the way the world experiences property. No matter where you're at on your property journey, we're here to help with every step - whether that's finding or financing your next home.

Our people are the key to our success. At the heart of everything we do, is a thriving culture centred around high performance and care. We are purpose driven and collaborative, which drives innovation and our ability to make a real impact. As such, we’re proud to be named in Australia’s “Top 5” Best Workplaces two  years in a row, as well as being recognised as a Best Workplace for Women.
Where the team fits in
Our Consumer Product and Experience group, headed up by Jonathan Swift, is the heart of REA Group, responsible for the flagship realestate.com.au mobile applications and website. And the Consumer Data Science squad has the critical mission of creating and operating products powered by ML/AI/data science to enable the best possible consumer experiences.
Our products and experiences are used by over 12 million consumers each month, and right in the middle of the action is this high-scale, high-impact Product Manager role. The Consumer group is all about connecting people with property and being a part of every property conversation, by designing market leading digital tools, content and features; and our data science products play an important role in that strategic vision.
As the Product Manager, you’ll be joining a highly technical, highly skilled squad of ML Engineers and Data Scientists, focusing on creating data-driven products and services. You’ll be responsible for forming and rolling out the roadmap for both greenfields and existing products and services that are key to the success of REA.
Joining at a crucial time when the mission of this squad is evolving, you will be instrumental in the creation of the product vision and strategy. You love focusing on concepts, outcomes and business value; you understand the technical challenges but are happy to step back from the technical implementation. You’re excited by data, online experiences, and the possibilities of machine learning and AI.
What the role is all about
Reporting to the Head of Product, collaborate with them to form the overall product strategy for ML/AI/data science within the Consumer group, and contribute to the overall strategy of the tribe.

Be front and centre for any discussions that are ML/AI/data science-related and that lead to the success of our products.
Take ownership of specific products and initiatives within Consumer, assess their value, shape their vision, and guide their execution.
Determine outcomes and priorities within individual initiatives, and balance enhancing existing products while also delivering new initiatives.
Collaborate with a highly talented multidisciplinary squad to break initiatives down into logical deliverables and evolve them as development progresses.
Own the operational aspects of product management for the squad, including creating and tracking OKRs, product reporting, forecasting, issue management, and documentation.
Undertake market scanning for advances in ML & AI, new tools, and opportunities for advantage.
Contribute to key communities within REA Group, such as the Product and Data Science communities.
Who we’re looking for
Someone with a few runs on the board in a product management or product development role – we are open to different levels of experience and backgrounds; your attitude and mindset is the most important thing to us!
A customer centric focus and commercial mindset (having value orchestration experience will serve you well in this role)
Experience with design thinking, design sprints, agile, lean start-up product principles a must. A track record with material examples of experimentation and lean product development. In the context of AI product specifically is highly desirable.  
Someone who is very comfortable working with technical teams who can help to communicate technical opportunities to business stakeholders at all levels of the business; with an understanding ML/AI/data science being ideal
Previous experience within data science or machine learning is highly desirable, such as successfully launching ML models into production and demonstrating their value
A good understanding of technical requirements and designs
Experience working in cross-functional teams within an Agile product development environment
Good use of initiative (lateral thinking and adaptability) and problem-solving skills
Business, commerce, technical degree, or equivalent industry experience
