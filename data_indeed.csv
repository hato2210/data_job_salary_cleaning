About Openmesh and Xnode
Today a handful of corporations control 90% of the world's data and IT infrastructure and we are expected to trust them. This is not just bad for business; it's bad for everyone. Information asymmetry has led to social inequality, scandals, polarization, and corruption. Sometimes, it has even led to war. Centralized data control acts as a potential chokepoint for innovation, raises privacy concerns, and creates a bottleneck for the free flow of data.
Openmesh is a cutting-edge new open-source cloud infrastructure and a global open data network aimed at storing important global data without a middleman. It is the largest open web3 data lake, covering approximately 80% of the entire crypto and web3 ecosystem today. In 2023 and 2024, we aim to expand our data coverage to include public health and scientific research data.
Openmesh enables anyone to create their own decentralized data cloud, connect globally, share data securely, slash deployment costs, and automate data cloud setup. The Openmesh Network is designed to collect, store, process, stream, and provide data connectivity for anyone, anywhere, anytime, without the need for registration, licensing, or payments. Think of Openmesh as the internet's open data fabric. It grants universal access and prevents interferences created by regulators, governments, corporations, and even its own creators. The possibilities are endless.
Core Products
Our flagship product, Xnode, is an integral part of this vision, offering a revolutionary platform for developers to build decentralized data clouds. Xnode, enables developers to build their own decentralized data clouds with data connectivity, data APIs, and query & analytics engines in mere minutes, instead of weeks or months. They pay only for computing and storage, sidestepping licensing and setup fees. Xnode facilitates a 10-15 fold cost reduction in running and operating data clouds and can save over 95% of deployment time.
Pythia is a powerhouse analytics & query engine that transforms raw data into actionable insights. Pythia allows anyone to design, build, visualize, and deploy powerful data products.

Data and IT infrastructure are the most valuable commodities in the world. Today, four to five large corporations manage 90% of the world's data and IT infrastructure, and we are supposed to trust them. We have a HUGE problem with that.
Openmesh Network is a four-year-old open-source DePIN project, with the majority of our 26 team members based in Sydney. Our team brings diverse experience from prominent Web3 projects, including Fantom, Ripple, Ethereum, Cosmos, AWS, and Aragon.
Openmesh is a P2P immutable data and decentralized cloud network. It combines the best features of AWS, IPFS, Chainlink, BitTorrent, and Oracle Cloud into a single solution. Openmesh provides immutable data via OpenAPIs and offers Web2/Web3 Infrastructure as a Service through Xnode.

Today a handful of corporations control 90% of the world's data and IT infrastructure and we are expected to trust them. This is not just bad for business; it's bad for everyone. Information asymmetry has led to social inequality, scandals, polarization, and corruption. Sometimes, it has even led to war. Centralized data control acts as a potential chokepoint for innovation, raises privacy concerns, and creates a bottleneck for the free flow of data.
Openmesh is a cutting-edge new open-source cloud infrastructure and a global open data network aimed at storing important global data without a middleman. It is the largest open web3 data lake, covering approximately 80% of the entire crypto and web3 ecosystem today. In 2023 and 2024, we aim to expand our data coverage to include public health and scientific research data.
Openmesh enables anyone to create their own decentralized data cloud, connect globally, share data securely, slash deployment costs, and automate data cloud setup. The Openmesh Network is designed to collect, store, process, stream, and provide data connectivity for anyone, anywhere, anytime, without the need for registration, licensing, or payments. Think of Openmesh as the internet's open data fabric. It grants universal access and prevents interferences created by regulators, governments, corporations, and even its own creators. The possibilities are endless.
Core Products
Our flagship product, Xnode, is an integral part of this vision, offering a revolutionary platform for developers to build decentralized data clouds. Xnode, enables developers to build their own decentralized data clouds with data connectivity, data APIs, and query & analytics engines in mere minutes, instead of weeks or months. They pay only for computing and storage, sidestepping licensing and setup fees. Xnode facilitates a 10-15 fold cost reduction in running and operating data clouds and can save over 95% of deployment time.
Pythia is a powerhouse analytics & query engine that transforms raw data into actionable insights. Pythia allows anyone to design, build, visualize, and deploy powerful data products.
Unified APIs provide a single endpoint for all crypto & web3 data, making it accessible to anyone, anywhere, without any costs. There are no licenses, registrations, or setup fees involved.
Our vision
Our vision is to democratize data and address information asymmetry at a scale. Data & information is the most valuable commodity in the world. Without quality, reliable data, all webpages, apps, and the entire internet will stop working. We believe access to reliable, unedited information is a fundamental right- an aspect of a free and democratic society. The Core Principles of Openmesh, by design, has no single authority that can alter its data, how the information is distributed or controlled, or who can see what and when. The infrastructure and entire technology stack is open-source and governed by an open-source community.
The opportunity
Learn groundbreaking innovations in Data, Cloud, Blockchain, AI, and Web3 Infrastructure from visionaries, and discover what your dream job is really like.

Bellroy's Data team is searching for a Data Engineer to help us make better decisions by getting our (many) data pipelines flowing smoothly and sensibly into a well-architected data platform.
We need your help to build, improve and maintain the infrastructure required to stream and enrich data from a variety of internal and external sources. Together, we will enhance our cloud-based data platform to get the right info, infer useful things and make better decisions. Then test, and keep improving. In areas where the data platform is already fully functional, you'll lend your sharp logic to improve internal processes, automate systems, and optimise, well, everything. And down the track, we'd love you to get involved with some Bayesian analysis, machine learning and other interesting data-related projects.
If you get excited by the idea of providing the right data to inform great decisions; and you want that data to be accessible, understandable and trustworthy, then this could be the job for you. If you bring your experience, smarts and detail-oriented brain to help us, we'll offer a world-class team to learn from, the tools you need to do your thing, and the support you need to flourish.

IF YOU WERE HERE IN THE FEW LAST WEEKS YOU MIGHT HAVE:
Reviewed our overall data systems (supported by very competent sysadmins) to make sure everything was in order and to look for larger-scale improvements
Built out a handful of new pipelines to bring more of our core business data into our data platform within our GCP and AWS environments
Chased a handful of data validation alerts raised by our pipelines, and taken the time to get to the root cause of each of them, then either delegated the fix to an appropriate someone else or fixed them yourself
Worked outside of data team, with our developers, flexing your database and query optimisation skills to decide whether to fix a performance issue they're having at the database level, or insist that the fix should be in the code (and, that's fun - they're an excellent bunch)
Provided an ad-hoc analysis (working with our analysts) to someone who requested it, integrating a one-off data source
Talked with our Data Manager about some of our mid-term plans, and how we'll support them with data
Re-engineered an existing data flow to handle an order-of-magnitude growth in the amount passing through the flow.

THESE ARE SOME QUALITIES YOU MUST POSSESS:
At least five years experience in a data engineering role
Advanced working knowledge of SQL and experience in ETL and streaming using a workflow management tool such as Apache NiFi (our chosen tool)
Experience with building and optimising data pipelines
Experience with collecting data from a variety of sources including APIs (good APIs, bad APIs, and ugly APIs)
Strong analytical skills and an ability to perform root cause analysis
Training in at least one of Computer Science, Statistics, Informatics, Information Systems or another relevant quantitative field (or demonstrable skill in one of those areas and the story of how you built that skill without formal training)
Very high precision – you need to know how to verify that your work is correct (even when dealing with unreliable data, where uncertainty may be inherent)

You will have the opportunity to contribute to the development of one of the world's first large-scale open data clouds and analytics engines. Openmesh is a dedicated global initiative that brings together brilliant minds in the tech industry to create open data and open infrastructures that will be pivotal in shaping the next 10-20 years.
This internship can be used for your 400 hours of industry experience (PEP 40). This is a 2-12 weeks paid internship to begin soon. The role will take place in our Sydney George St. Office. Unlock your career potential by working with a world class team, opportunity for permanent job placements, competitive salaries, and exciting cash prize competitions!
About Openmesh and Xnode
Today a handful of corporations control 90% of the world's data and IT infrastructure and we are expected to trust them. This is not just bad for business; it's bad for everyone. Information asymmetry has led to social inequality, scandals, polarization, and corruption. Sometimes, it has even led to war. Centralized data control acts as a potential chokepoint for innovation, raises privacy concerns, and creates a bottleneck for the free flow of data.
Openmesh is a cutting-edge new open-source cloud infrastructure and a global open data network aimed at storing important global data without a middleman. It is the largest open web3 data lake, covering approximately 80% of the entire crypto and web3 ecosystem today. In 2023 and 2024, we aim to expand our data coverage to include public health and scientific research data.
Openmesh enables anyone to create their own decentralized data cloud, connect globally, share data securely, slash deployment costs, and automate data cloud setup. The Openmesh Network is designed to collect, store, process, stream, and provide data connectivity for anyone, anywhere, anytime, without the need for registration, licensing, or payments. Think of Openmesh as the internet's open data fabric. It grants universal access and prevents interferences created by regulators, governments, corporations, and even its own creators. The possibilities are endless.
Core Products
Our flagship product, Xnode, is an integral part of this vision, offering a revolutionary platform for developers to build decentralized data clouds. Xnode, enables developers to build their own decentralized data clouds with data connectivity, data APIs, and query & analytics engines in mere minutes, instead of weeks or months. They pay only for computing and storage, sidestepping licensing and setup fees. Xnode facilitates a 10-15 fold cost reduction in running and operating data clouds and can save over 95% of deployment time.
Pythia is a powerhouse analytics & query engine that transforms raw data into actionable insights. Pythia allows anyone to design, build, visualize, and deploy powerful data products.
Unified APIs provide a single endpoint for all crypto & web3 data, making it accessible to anyone, anywhere, without any costs. There are no licenses, registrations, or setup fees involved.
Our vision
Our vision is to democratize data and address information asymmetry at a scale. Data & information is the most valuable commodity in the world. Without quality, reliable data, all webpages, apps, and the entire internet will stop working. We believe access to reliable, unedited information is a fundamental right- an aspect of a free and democratic society. The Core Principles of Openmesh, by design, has no single authority that can alter its data, how the information is distributed or controlled, or who can see what and when. The infrastructure and entire technology stack is open-source and governed by an open-source community.
The opportunity
Leverage this paid internship opportunity to fulfill your PEP 40H industry experience requirement.
Learn groundbreaking innovations in Data, Cloud, Blockchain, AI, and Web3 Infrastructure from visionaries, senior engineers, product owners and discover what your dream job is really like. You will be given access to our open source technology, hackathons, virtual conferences, mentoring sessions, R&D infrastructure, workshops, and an opportunity to observe and apply your knowledge in practice. You have the option to work in person or remotely. There is an upcoming hackathon on the 28th. Career Progression - top-performing candidates will receive a full-time offer.

Data and IT infrastructure are the most valuable commodities in the world. Today, four to five large corporations manage 90% of the world's data and IT infrastructure, and we are supposed to trust them. We have a HUGE problem with that.
Openmesh Network is a four-year-old open-source DePIN project, with the majority of our 26 team members based in Sydney. Our team brings diverse experience from prominent Web3 projects, including Fantom, Ripple, Ethereum, Cosmos, AWS, and Aragon.
Openmesh is a P2P immutable data and decentralized cloud network. It combines the best features of AWS, IPFS, Chainlink, BitTorrent, and Oracle Cloud into a single solution. Openmesh provides immutable data via OpenAPIs and offers Web2/Web3 Infrastructure as a Service through Xnode.
Xnode manages Openmesh network resources, including computational power and storage, across various deployment environments. Each Xnode operates as a microservice, enhancing the overall efficiency and integrity of the Openmesh network. Collectively, Xnodes form a network of data collectors, aggregators, and validators that facilitate a global system of data verification and dissemination.
The Xnode Studio is a platform for infrastructure design, development, and management solutions where users can assemble Web2 and Web3 infrastructure like Lego blocks. It enables developers, startups, and enterprise users to quickly build Web2 and Web3 infrastructure such as validator nodes, data clouds, building data APIs, P2P compute and storage layers, analytic engines, hosting services in minutes rather than weeks. Users can combine complex infrastructure leveraging interconnected worldwide data centers and fiber connectivity. Xnode Studio features a powerful resource aggregation engine that scans through thousands of combinations of bare metal and cloud providers across various cities, regions, and countries to find the best resources such as compute, storage, and GPUs for your infrastructure needs, similar to how Skyscanner scans for airlines.
Xnode and Openmesh advancements, breakthroughs, and innovations are designed to accelerate the Web3 industry by building the next generation of open data and infrastructure, which will be pivotal for the next 10-20 years.
Our vision:
Our vision is to democratize data and address information asymmetry at a scale. Data & information is the most valuable commodity in the world. Without quality, reliable data, all webpages, apps, and the entire internet will stop working. We believe access to reliable, unedited information is a fundamental right- an aspect of a free and democratic society. The Core Principles of Openmesh, by design, has no single authority that can alter its data, how the information is distributed or controlled, or who can see what and when. The infrastructure and entire technology stack is open-source and governed by an open-source community.

You will have the opportunity to contribute to the development of one of the world's first large-scale open data clouds and analytics engines. Openmesh is a dedicated global initiative that brings together brilliant minds in the tech industry to create open data and open infrastructures that will be pivotal in shaping the next 10-20 years.

Unlock your career potential by working with a world class team, opportunities for permanent job placements, competitive salaries, and exciting cash prize competitions!

About Openmesh and Xnode
Today a handful of corporations control 90% of the world's data and IT infrastructure and we are expected to trust them. This is not just bad for business; it's bad for everyone. Information asymmetry has led to social inequality, scandals, polarization, and corruption. Sometimes, it has even led to war. Centralized data control acts as a potential chokepoint for innovation, raises privacy concerns, and creates a bottleneck for the free flow of data.
Openmesh is a cutting-edge new open-source cloud infrastructure and a global open data network aimed at storing important global data without a middleman. It is the largest open web3 data lake, covering approximately 80% of the entire crypto and web3 ecosystem today. In 2023 and 2024, we aim to expand our data coverage to include public health and scientific research data.
Openmesh enables anyone to create their own decentralized data cloud, connect globally, share data securely, slash deployment costs, and automate data cloud setup. The Openmesh Network is designed to collect, store, process, stream, and provide data connectivity for anyone, anywhere, anytime, without the need for registration, licensing, or payments. Think of Openmesh as the internet's open data fabric. It grants universal access and prevents interferences created by regulators, governments, corporations, and even its own creators. The possibilities are endless.
Core Products
Our flagship product, Xnode, is an integral part of this vision, offering a revolutionary platform for developers to build decentralized data clouds. Xnode, enables developers to build their own decentralized data clouds with data connectivity, data APIs, and query & analytics engines in mere minutes, instead of weeks or months. They pay only for computing and storage, sidestepping licensing and setup fees. Xnode facilitates a 10-15 fold cost reduction in running and operating data clouds and can save over 95% of deployment time.
Pythia is a powerhouse analytics & query engine that transforms raw data into actionable insights. Pythia allows anyone to design, build, visualize, and deploy powerful data products.
Unified APIs provide a single endpoint for all crypto & web3 data, making it accessible to anyone, anywhere, without any costs. There are no licenses, registrations, or setup fees involved.
Our vision
Our vision is to democratize data and address information asymmetry at a scale. Data & information is the most valuable commodity in the world. Without quality, reliable data, all webpages, apps, and the entire internet will stop working. We believe access to reliable, unedited information is a fundamental right- an aspect of a free and democratic society. The Core Principles of Openmesh, by design, has no single authority that can alter its data, how the information is distributed or controlled, or who can see what and when. The infrastructure and entire technology stack is open-source and governed by an open-source community.

The opportunity
Leverage this paid internship opportunity to fulfill your PEP 40H industry experience requirement.
Learn groundbreaking innovations in Data, Cloud, Blockchain, AI, and Web3 Infrastructure from visionaries, senior engineers, product owners and discover what your dream job is really like.

We help clients navigate tech risks through internal investigations and forensically analysing electronic evidence collected from phones, computers, networks, storage devices and backup systems.

Who we are
The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) is part of the Commonwealth Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. As primary agency for Australia's Antarctic Program (AAP), the AAD is responsible for achieving the Australian Government's Antarctic goals. These goals are to:
Maintain the Antarctic Treaty System and enhance Australia's influence within it.
Protect the Antarctic environment.
Understand the role of Antarctica in the global climate system.
Undertake scientific work of practical, economic and national significance.
The AAD also has responsibility for administering the Australian Antarctic Territory and the Territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands.

The AAD Science Branch leads, conducts and supports a world class program of scientific research and environmental management, consistent with national priorities through the Australian Antarctic Science Strategic Plan. The branch provides research and advice to support Australia’s Antarctic policy objectives, including participation in the Antarctic Treaty system and other international committees, commissions and intergovernmental panels. It manages and administers the Australian Antarctic Science Program and provides scientific and research advice to support regulatory and management decisions.

The branch provides advice for Antarctic capability projects, conducts impact assessments and develops and implements strategies to address environmental legacies while undertaking targeted outreach promoting the value of Australian Antarctic science. The responsibilities of the Science Branch are diverse as we lead the Australian Government’s scientific program in Antarctica. Our research addresses critical issues including climate change, the human footprint in Antarctica, and the conservation of Antarctic and Southern Ocean wildlife. Our diverse research program covers physical and life sciences in the atmosphere, terrestrial and marine domains.

The Environmental Stewardship Program (ESP), within the Science Branch, is a multidisciplinary program that conducts scientific research and implements evidence-based conservation, environmental management, environmental assessments, remediation and mitigation actions in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic. The program collaborates closely across the AAD to deliver an “actionable Cleaner Antarctica Strategy” for Australian stations, as well as scientific, environmental management and policy outcomes. Key to meeting Australia’s Environmental Stewardship goals is the coordinated use and visualisation of available data to inform evidence based environmental management, planning and policy decisions.

As such, a Geospatial Environmental Management System (GEMS) will be developed and maintained for the collation, display and interrogation of spatial, environmental and station data at and adjacent to Australian Antarctic stations and field camps. For use by all work areas across the AAD, GEMS will enhance the AAD’s ability to minimise and mitigate localised impacts on Antarctica’s unique biodiversity, wilderness and heritage values and support positive environmental outcomes in the planning of on-going operations, new capabilities, redevelopment, decommissioning and remediation at stations and the surrounding environment. The development of GEMS is a key objective of the Australian Antarctic Strategy and 20 Year Action Plan (2022 update).

The Job
The Environmental Data Analyst will be responsible for leading a range of data, database, GIS and data visualisation needs of the Environmental Stewardship Program and Science Branch, with primary responsibility for the data management and systems, implementation and management of GEMS.

Working to independently specify and evaluate solutions.
Documenting, administering, and maintaining the resulting application.
Strategic engagement and collaboration with internal and external stakeholders to communicate relevant technical capabilities and emerging opportunities in the areas of scientific application development and data management that support Environmental Stewardship.
Working in conjunction with the Australian Antarctic Data Centre and the Integrated Digital East Antarctic Program to ensure that GEMS, as a key spatial tool for sustainable environmental planning and management, takes advantage of synergies with the Integrated Digital East Antarctica Program, including sharing of resources and relevant data and data products.
Being a positive team member, and at times, leader of seasonal field programs (whether in Antarctica or from Kingston), leading technical training, field sampling, data gathering, and environmental monitoring at the AAD’s sub-Antarctic and Antarctic stations.
Engaging widely, with advanced skills, to develop and maintain excellent relations with a diverse group of collaborative partners and stakeholders throughout the AAD and with external partners to deliver on environmental stewardship priorities.
