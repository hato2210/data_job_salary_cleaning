We prioritize candidate safety. Please be aware that all official communication will only be sent from @Rippling.com addresses.
About the role
After becoming one of the fastest growing startups in the United States ($0 → $13.5B) Rippling is setting its sights on APAC. That’s where you come in.
We’re looking for a growth leader with a founder’s mentality to lead growth marketing for APAC. This person demonstrates a track record of driving pipeline / revenue and a good understanding of the market. The role won’t be easy, but it will be fun. More importantly, it will play a major part in sustaining Rippling’s growth trajectory. 
You’ll manage your own budget across multiple channels to maximise ARR and CAC efficiency. Partnering closely with the SDR and AE sales teams, you’ll launch new experiments to help us go from 0>1, then achieve IPO scale. 
This role is based in Sydney, Australia and will be Hybrid- 3 days in office. 
What you will do
Drive New Logo Sales (NLS) pipeline for our APAC sales team. You’ll strategize, prioritize, and run full-stack campaigns and experiments across multiple acquisition channels (inbound and outbound) to hit aggressive direct and influenced pipeline targets. This may involve launching and optimising paid digital channels, SEO, intent data signal building, website conversion, integrated campaigns and more. 
Build a playbook for APAC. You’ll work closely with sales to build a repeatable demand generation playbook for APAC
Build and execute growth strategy across new markets. You’ll be responsible for building growth plans and executing against those plans across each new market we enter
Collaborate with stakeholders across multiple teams to execute complex cross-functional initiatives that move the business forward.
Constantly innovate and push the envelope, moving beyond typical B2B marketing playbooks to unlock scale and ROI.
What you will need
A hacker’s mentality. You obsess over finding novel ways to hit goals—even when the conventional wisdom says you’re wrong.
6-9 years of experience in growth marketing across multiple channels (SEM, email, paid social, etc.) B2B experience is strongly preferred. We’ll expect you to operate multiple channels autonomously.
Ability to build systems. You know how to understand existing growth systems, leverage them to scale, and drive transformation where necessary. 
Ability to navigate through ambiguity. You know where we need to go, but recognise it won’t always be a straight path to get there.
Extreme autonomy and ownership. As the pipeline owner for our APAC markets, we’ll expect you to be able to operate autonomously to hit your goals.
Strong attention to detail. You can dive into the weeds with your team and pick up on the seemingly small, yet important, details.
Strong data and analytical orientation. You possess the analytical frameworks to break down problems and the ability to analyse large sets of data to drive actionable insights. SQL skill is strongly preferred. 
Excellent verbal and written communication skills. You’ll regularly communicate directly with executives and other senior leaders.
Bias for speed. We move very quickly, and will expect you to set a similar pace for your team. 
Understanding of APAC culture and norms. You don’t have to be from Sydney, but you do need to demonstrate an understanding of how to market to APAC companies, particularly in Australia and Southeast Asia.

357,Graduate Software Engineers,Rokt,Sydney NSW,missing,missing,missing,missing,missing,"The Role:
We’re looking for enthusiastic Graduate Software Engineers to join our graduate program at Rokt. You’ve studied hard, completed labs, had some experience and now you’re ready to start coding and ship. With Rokt we’ll give you the tools, support and environment to get straight into coding. You will join a team of experienced engineers who are passionate about writing world class code.
In your first week you’ll have your first task, your first month, you will have completed a number of fixes and features (at least one of which will be in production), started peer-reviewing your colleagues’ code, you will be participating in team task estimations and have a growing understanding of your team's systems. By the end of your first year you will have led design workshops, started to master a handful of technologies and taken primary responsibility for a small system (or a component in a larger system).
While you start with one engineering team, your opportunities will be throughout the engineering structure and you'll work with other teams to get exposure to the whole business.
Engineers at Rokt are not afraid of a challenge; we thrive on using our creativity and delivering suitable solutions. Find where your true passion lies!
The Tech Stack
The platform employs a globally distributed micro-services and event driven data pipeline architecture to process the millions of daily consumer interactions that occur on the Rokt network.  
There are currently more than 20 scrum teams working on a huge variety of fascinating challenges at Rokt.  We believe in using the right tool for the job. We pick technologies not because they’re shiny and new, but because they solve a problem. Our mantra is: you build it, you own it.  We strive to give teams autonomy; each team owns its technology choices, tooling, test automation, deployment pipelines, and monitoring and alerting.
Our teams craft their work using languages such as Python, C#, Clojure, Scala, Kotlin and Swift.  Our frontends are built on React and Angular frameworks powered by Javascript and Typescript. Our infrastructure is hosted on AWS, and we like to leverage technologies like SQS, Kinesis, and Redshift.  But more and more we’re turning to open source technologies such as Postgresql, Kafka, EMR and Spark to achieve our goals.

Collaborative, flexible, innovative workplace that values you and your career development
Join CSIRO – Australia's premier research organisation
CSIRO Early Research Career (CERC) Postdoctoral Fellowships provide opportunities to scientists and engineers who have completed their doctorate and have less than three years of relevant postdoctoral work experience. These fellowships aim to develop the next generation of future leaders of the innovation system.
The escalating spread of mosquito populations and associated diseases, influenced by anthropomorphic activities and climate change, poses a disproportionate threat to vulnerable populations in tropical regions, including the Torres Strait and the Pacific. Addressing this complex challenge requires transdisciplinary approaches and community-led interventions. In collaboration with local Indigenous communities, we are currently co-designing mosquito control with a focus on empowerment and self-determination, using a world leading, commercial self-limiting mosquito control technology that is highly scalable and environmentally friendly. 
  The CERC Fellow will develop computational models, supported by lab and field experiments, in partnership with Indigenous communities. The project will enable self-determination of an Indigenous mosquito control business through co-design and optimisation of decision-making processes, reducing the disease burden through a culturally sensitive approach that empowers Indigenous communities.
Your duties will include:
Develop and or extend mathematical and computational population process models to study the effects of different population suppression and replacement strategies across several spatial and temporal contexts. 
Analyse data using statistical and/or machine learning approaches as appropriate to improve our understanding of population parameter variation based on available biological data.
Explore novel hypotheses and provide recommendations for field trials of various next generation mosquito control technologies.
Deliver model outcomes to key partners.
Support the establishment of trusted relationships with Indigenous Cultural Knowledge holders, Communities and organisations.

The opportunity
Great opportunity for an early career researcher with a PhD in polymer physics, biophysics, food science, process engineering or chemical engineering 
Be supported by a team of experts at CSIRO, Monash University, Australia's Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) and Wageningen University (Netherlands)
3-year postdoctoral fellowship based in Melbourne including regular research visits to the ANSTO campus near Sydney
CSIRO Early Research Career (CERC) Postdoctoral Fellowships provide opportunities to scientists and engineers who have completed their doctorate and have less than three years of relevant postdoctoral work experience. These fellowships aim to develop the next generation of future leaders of the innovation system.

Extrusion of food biopolymers (protein, starch, fibre) can create fibrous structures with meat-like texture, i.e. meat analogues. So far, meat analogues have not been able to deliver an eating experience that convinces meat-eaters to switch to planet-friendly alternatives. The bottleneck slowing meat analogue innovation is a lack of knowledge about the structural and biochemical transformations occurring in the extruder barrel and die.

We aim to establish an experimental platform for in situ small angle neutron scattering (SANS) studies of extrusion processes. This will involve commissioning a small extruder inside a neutron scattering instrument, and collecting scattering data while the extruder is operated. Advanced machine learning tools will be developed or deployed to extract structural information from scattering data, and conceptual and analytical frameworks developed to build process-structure-function understanding that enables rapid optimisation of product quality.
  Your duties will include:
Leading a design and feasibility study for extruder commissioning at ANSTO
Building a knowledge base by running lab-scale extrusion trials with various conditions and formulations, and analysing extrudate samples offline
Working with machine learning experts to develop frameworks for automated analysis of scattering data
Working with biophysics experts to develop conceptual and mathematical models of polymer phase behaviour in extrudates
Carrying out innovative, impactful research of strategic importance to CSIRO that will, where possible, lead to novel and important scientific outcomes
Location: Werribee, Melbourne, Victoria (plus regular 1-4 week duration research visits, several times a year to Sydney)
Salary: AU$96k - AU$105k plus up to 15.4% superannuation
Tenure: Specified term of 3 years
Reference: 97383
To be considered you will need:
A doctorate (or will shortly satisfy the requirements of a PhD) in a relevant discipline area, such as polymer physics, biophysics, food science, process engineering or chemical engineering. Please note: To be eligible for this role you must have no more than 3 years (full-time equivalent) of postdoctoral research experience.
Expertise in conceptualising and validating structure-function linkages in dynamic, heterogeneous soft material systems. The ability to formulate hypotheses about molecular and structural processes occurring in soft materials at wide-ranging length and time scales, and to explain how these processes interact across structural hierarchies to drive product functionality.
Experience in advanced characterisation of soft materials, e.g. rheology, microscopy, particle sizing.
Experience in the design, execution, and analysis of experiments with the purpose of gaining new understandings of a physical system.
High level written and oral communication skills with the ability to represent the research team effectively internally and externally, including the presentation of research outcomes at national and international conferences.
Eligibility
Appointment to this role is subject to provision of a national police check and may be subject to other security/medical/character requirements.
Flexible working arrangements
We work flexibly at CSIRO, offering a range of options for how, when and where you work.
