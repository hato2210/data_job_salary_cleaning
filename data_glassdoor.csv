Kingston, TAS
Who we are
The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) is part of the Commonwealth Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. As primary agency for Australia's Antarctic Program (AAP), the AAD is responsible for achieving the Australian Government's Antarctic goals. These goals are to:
Maintain the Antarctic Treaty System and enhance Australia's influence within it.
Protect the Antarctic environment.
The AAD also has responsibility for administering the Australian Antarctic Territory and the Territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands.

The AAD Science Branch leads, conducts and supports a world class program of scientific research and environmental management, consistent with national priorities through the Australian Antarctic Science Strategic Plan. The branch provides research and advice to support Australia’s Antarctic policy objectives, including participation in the Antarctic Treaty system and other international committees, commissions and intergovernmental panels. It manages and administers the Australian Antarctic Science Program and provides scientific and research advice to support regulatory and management decisions.

The branch provides advice for Antarctic capability projects, conducts impact assessments and develops and implements strategies to address environmental legacies while undertaking targeted outreach promoting the value of Australian Antarctic science. The responsibilities of the Science Branch are diverse as we lead the Australian Government’s scientific program in Antarctica. Our research addresses critical issues including climate change, the human footprint in Antarctica, and the conservation of Antarctic and Southern Ocean wildlife. Our diverse research program covers physical and life sciences in the atmosphere, terrestrial and marine domains.

The Environmental Stewardship Program (ESP), within the Science Branch, is a multidisciplinary program that conducts scientific research and implements evidence-based conservation, environmental management, environmental assessments, remediation and mitigation actions in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic. The program collaborates closely across the AAD to deliver an “actionable Cleaner Antarctica Strategy” for Australian stations, as well as scientific, environmental management and policy outcomes. Key to meeting Australia’s Environmental Stewardship goals is the coordinated use and visualisation of available data to inform evidence based environmental management, planning and policy decisions.

As such, a Geospatial Environmental Management System (GEMS) will be developed and maintained for the collation, display and interrogation of spatial, environmental and station data at and adjacent to Australian Antarctic stations and field camps. For use by all work areas across the AAD, GEMS will enhance the AAD’s ability to minimise and mitigate localised impacts on Antarctica’s unique biodiversity, wilderness and heritage values and support positive environmental outcomes in the planning of on-going operations, new capabilities, redevelopment, decommissioning and remediation at stations and the surrounding environment. The development of GEMS is a key objective of the Australian Antarctic Strategy and 20 Year Action Plan (2022 update).


The Environmental Data Analyst will be responsible for leading a range of data, database, GIS and data visualisation needs of the Environmental Stewardship Program and Science Branch, with primary responsibility for the data management and systems, implementation and management of GEMS.
